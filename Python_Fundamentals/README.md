# Python_Fundamentals
## Definitions of terms

1. **Natural language** :Natural language such as English is the language, which is spoken and written for communication.

2. **Programming language** :Programming languages are used for developing computer programs, which enable a computer to perform some operations.

3. **Source code** : A program written in a high-level programming language.

4. **Source file** : The file containing the source code.

There are two different ways of transforming a program from a high-level programming language into machine language:

5. **Compilation** : The source program is translated once by getting a file containing the machine code, execution will be faster.

6. **Interpretation** : The source program is translated each time it has to be run.

6. **Positional arguments** : The arguments whose meaning is dictated by their position.

6. **Keyword arguments** : The arguments whose meaning is not dictated by their location, but by a special word (keyword) used to identify them.

## Print ( )
```python
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n')
```
The sep parameter specifies the separator between the outputted arguments.

The end parameter specifies what to print at the end of the print statement.



## Input ( )
Input() function gets data from the console. The result of the input() function is a **string**. 
```python
x = input("Enter a number: ") # The user enters 2
print(type(x)) #output is <class 'str'>
```

**Type casting**
* int() : convert one argument into an integer
* float() : convert one argument into a float
* str() : convert a number into a string

## Literals
    A literal is data whose values are determined by the literal itself.

1. **String** : "I am a literal."

    Escape Character: \
  
    ```python
    'I\'m happy' = "I'm happy"
    ```
    Two ways to encode apostrophe or quote:
    * Using Escape character \
    * Open and close the string using an opposite set of symbols(e.g., "I'm happy.",  'He loves "Python" very much' )
    
    **Concatenation(+)**
    
    Must ensure that both its arguments are strings.
    ```python
    num_1 = input("Enter the first number: ") # Enter 12
    num_2 = input("Enter the second number: ") # Enter 21
    print(num_1 + num_2) # the program returns 1221
    
    ```
    
    **Replication(*)**
    
    A number less than or equal to zero produces an empty string.
    ```python
    my_input = input("Enter something: ") # Example input: hello
    print(my_input * 3) #output: hellohellohello
    print(my_input * (-1)) #output is empty
    ```

2. **Integers** : They are numbers written without a fractional component, e.g., 256, or -1 (negative integers).

    You can write this number either like this: 11111111, or like that: 11_111_111.

    Note:Python 3.6 has introduced underscores in numeric literals, allowing for placing single underscores between digits and after base specifiers for improved readability.

3. **Float** : They are numbers that contain (or are able to contain) a fractional component, e.g., 1.27.

    Scientific notation: 3E8 = 3*pow(10,8)

    **Note1**:
    The exponent (the value after the E) has to be an integer;
    The base (the value in front of the E) may be an integer.
    
    **Note2**: you can omit zero when it is the only digit in front of or after the decimal point.
    0.4 = .4 , 4.0 = 4.

4. **Boolean** : The two constant objects True and False used to represent truth values.

5. **Octal and Hexadecimal**:

    Octal: An integer number is preceded by an 0O or 0o prefix (zero-o), it will be treated as an octal value.(e.g. 0o123 = 83)
    
    Hexadecimal: An integer number is preceded by an 0x or 0X prefix (zero-x), it will be treated as an hexadecimal value.(e.g. 0x123 = 291)

6. **None**: It is used to represent the absence of a value.

## Arithmetic Operators
**Unary operator** vs **binary operator**:
```
* A unary operator is an operator with only one operand, e.g., -1, or +3.
* A binary operator is an operator with two operands, e.g., 4 + 5, or 12 % 5.
```

**Integer** vs **float** Rules:
```
* When both ** arguments are integers, the result is an integer, too;
* When at least one ** argument is a float, the result is a float, too.
* But there is an exception: The result produced by the division operator is always a float.
```
1. Addition ("+")
```python
print(-4 + 4) #output is 0
print(-4. + 8) #output is 4.0
```
2. Substraction ("-")
```python
print(-4 - 4) #output is -8
print(4. - 8) #output is -4.0
print(-1.1) #output is -1.1
```
3. Multiplication ("*")
```python
print(2 * 3) #output is 6
print(2 * 3.) #output is 6.0
print(2. * 3) #output is 6.0
print(2. * 3.) #output is 6.0
```

4. Division ("/")
```python
print(6 / 3) #output is 2.0
print(6 / 3.) #output is 2.0
print(6. / 3) #output is 2.0
print(6. / 3.) #output is 2.0
```
5. Integer division ("//")
```python
print(6 // 4) #output is 1
print(6. // 4) #output is 1.0
print(-6 // 4) #output is -2
print(6. // -4) #output is -2.0
```

   This is very important: rounding always goes to the lesser integer.

6. Remaimder ("%")

  The result of the operator is a remainder left after the integer division.

  Remaimder is sometimes called **modulo** in other programming languages.
```python
print(14 % 4) #output is 2
print(12 % 4.5) #output is 3.0 
```

7. Exponentiation (**)
```python
print(2 ** 3) #output is 8
print(2 ** 3.) #output is 8.0
print(2. ** 3) #output is 8.0
print(2. ** 3.) #output is 8.0
```

8. Compound assignment operators

    If op is a two-argument operator (this is a very important condition) and the operator is used in the following context:
    ```
    variable = variable op expression
    ```

    It can be simplified and shown as follows:
    ```
    variable op= expression
    ```
    
    ```python
    var = 2
    print(var) #output is 2

    var = 3
    print(var) #output is 3

    var += 1
    print(var) #output is 4
    
    ```
## Relational Operators

1. Equal to ("==")
2. Not equal to ("!=")
3. Greater than (">")
4. Greater than or equal to (">=")
5. Less than ("<")
6. Less than or equal to ("<=")

## Logical operators

1. And

| Argument A  |     Argument B      | A and B |
| ----------- |---------------------| :------:|
|   False     |     False           | False   |
|   False     |     True            | False   |
|   True      |     False           | False   |
|   True      |     True            | True    |


2. Or

| Argument A  |     Argument B      | A or B  |
| ----------- |---------------------| :------:|
|   False     |     False           | False   |
|   False     |     True            | True    |
|   True      |     False           | True    |
|   True      |     True            | True    |

3. Not

| Argument    |  not Argument|
| ----------- | :-----------:|
|   False     |     True     |
|   True      |     False    |

## Bitwise operators
1. &    (ampersand) - conjunction
2. |    (bar) - disjunction
3. ~    (tilde) - negation
4. ^    (caret) - exclusive or(xor)

| Argument A | Argument B | A&B | A\|B |  A^B  |
| ---------- | ---------- | --- | --- | :---: |
|      0     |      0     |  0  |  0  |    0  |
|      0     |      0     |  0  |  1  |    1  |
|      1     |      0     |  0  |  1  |    1  |
|      1     |      0     |  1  |  1  |    0  |
Let's make it easier:

* & requires exactly two 1s to provide 1 as the result;
* | requires at least one 1 to provide 1 as the result;
* ^ requires exactly one 1 to provide 1 as the result.

| Argument | ~Argument|
| -------- |:--------:|
|      0   |    1     |
|      1   |    0     |



**Operators bindings**:
* Most of Python's operators have left-sided binding, which means that the calculation of the expression is conducted from left to right.
* But there is an exception, the exponentiation operator uses right-sided binding.
```python
print(2 ** 2 ** 3) #output is 256
```

**Operator priorities**:
| Priority  |     Operator       | 
| --------- |:------------------:| 
|     1     |     **             |
|     2     |     ~,+,- (unary)  |
|     3     |     *, /, //, %    |
|     4     |     +, -(binary)   |
|     5     |     <<,>>          |
|     6     |     &              |
|     7     |     ^              |
|     8     |     \|             |
|     9     |     <,<=,>,>=,==,!=|
|     10    |     not X          |
|     11    |     and            |
|     12    |     or             |




## Variables
 A **variable** is a named location reserved to store values in the memory. A variable is created or initialized automatically when you assign a value to it for the first time.
```python
var = 1
print(var) #output is 1
```
 
**Name Convention**
* The name of the variable must be composed of upper-case or lower-case letters, digits, and the character _ (underscore).
* The name of the variable must begin with a letter.
* Upper- and lower-case letters are treated as different.
* The name of the variable must not be any of Python's reserved words .

**Combine text and variable**

You can combine text and variables using the "+" operator, and use the print() function to output strings and variables
```python
var = "007"
print("Agent " + var) #output is Agent007
```
